# World Countries Information Database

Welcome to the World Countries Information Database project. This repository is designed to provide comprehensive data analysis and queries related to world countries, their ethnic groups, religions, and more, leveraging SQL queries and Apache AsterixDB.

## Overview

This project contains SQL queries and scripts for analyzing various aspects of world countries. The data includes information on ethnic groups, major religions, population data, and specific country-focused queries like information on Peru. Additionally, it features integration with Apache AsterixDB for advanced data management and querying capabilities.

## Contents

- **Apache AsterixDB 0.9.6**: Contains setup and configuration files for Apache AsterixDB, a highly scalable big data management system.
- **SQL Queries (.sqlp files)**: These files contain prepared SQL queries for analyzing different datasets. Examples include:
  - `ethnic_group.sqlp`: Queries related to ethnic groups across different countries.
  - `filtered_seas.sqlp`: Information on seas filtered by certain criteria.
  - `peru_info.sqlp`: Specific queries related to the country of Peru.
  - `world_religion.sqlp` and `world_religion_pop.sqlp`: Queries on world religions and their populations.

## Getting Started

To utilize the queries and datasets provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Apache AsterixDB**: Follow the instructions in the `apache-asterixdb-0.9.6` directory to set up your AsterixDB instance.
2. **Run SQL Queries**: Use the provided `.sqlp` files to run queries against your database. These can be executed through your preferred SQL client or through the AsterixDB web interface if applicable.
